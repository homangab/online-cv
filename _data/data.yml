    title: About Me
    summary: |
      Hi! I am a senior undergraduate in the [Department of Computer
      Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/) at [IIT Kanpur](https://iitk.ac.in/), India. I am engaged in the
      quest for Artificial General Intelligence. Although this quest has kept me fully occupied for the past three years, I also paint, and have a Bachelor of Arts degree in Fine Arts. Some of my paintings can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FhIxxfnaQlrcKf_eLWrwdE27hNQykkno?usp=sharing).

      I am fortunate to have been advised by fantastic researchers 
      over the course of my undergraduate studies. Most recently,
      I have worked under the guidance of Prof [Yoshua Bengio](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~bengioy/yoshua_en/) and 
      Prof  [Liam Paull](http://liampaull.ca/) at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/), Montreal during the summers of 2018. 
      My work in [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) focused on the problem of sim-to-real transfer of deep learning based planning algorithms 
      in robotic navigation. Prior to this, I spent a wonderful winter at [NUS](http://nus.edu.sg/), Singapore in Prof [Brian Lim](http://www.brianlim.net/)'s lab. 
      I continued collaborating remotely and successfully completed two projects on Recommendation Systems and 
      Multi-Task Learning respectively. In IIT Kanpur, I work with Prof [Nisheeth Srivastava](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2dgYRikAAAAJ&hl=en) on Human-Computer Interaction
      and with Prof [Piyush Rai](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/piyush/) on developing Generative Zero Shot Learning algorithms.

         I was fortunate to have been advised by Prof Yoshua and Prof Liam Paull 
         for my project in Mila which focused on designing a sim-to-real transfer 
         framework for the task of robotic navigation. Our model consists of a planner,
         which given an initial image and a goal image, computes a plan by gradient descent. 
         The planner is first trained through expert trajectories in simulation followed by 
         an adversarial domain transfer of the encoder by the use of unlabelled images from
         simulation and the real setup. Finally, using very few expert demonstrations in the
         real setup, we showed successful performance on real world navigation tasks. The draft
         of the paper originating out of this work has been submitted to ICRA 2019 and is
         currently under review. 
          

    - role: Visiting Researcher
      time: Nov 2017 - Jan 2018
      company: NUS, Singapore

        In Prof Brian's lab, I worked at the intersection of machine learning and HCI through the two projects
        described below
        
          -  The first involved designing an Algorithm for recommendation systems. Based on recent 
          developments in Deep Generative Models for learning effective latent representations and 
          the advancements in stable training of Gated Recurrent Unit based Recurrent Neural Networks, 
          I developed a Recurrent Generative Adversarial Framework for time-series recommendation. 
          The algorithm comprises of a Generative Adversarial Network that uses a GRU-RNN each for
          the generator and the discriminator. We incorporated notions from HCI like the fact that some
          users have eclectic choices while others have a more habitual preference trend in the design 
          of the GRU cells for the generator and the discriminator. The research paper originating out 
          of this work has been published in proceedings of the 12th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems. 

          - My second project in Prof Brian's group at NUS involved designing an algorithm for classifying
           the healthiness of drinks. I worked remotely for this project and closely collaborated with Prof Brian's postdoc 
           Dr. Homin Park. We designed different auxiliary tasks like drink logo detection, drink container properties and drink type 
           classification to aid in the primary tasks of sugar level detection and alcohol level detection and experimented 
           with several Multi-Task Learning based Deep Neural Net architectures. We also curated a dataset of drink images 
           and the corresponding labels for auxiliary tasks. The draft of the paper originating out of this work is currently under
           review at a double-blind peer-reviewed conference. 

    - role: Undergraduate Researcher

        I've had an enriching research experience at IIT Kanpur so far, working under the guidance of Prof Nisheeth Srivastava and Prof 
        Piyush Rai. The two strands of research I have been a part of are described below

          - My work with Prof Nisheeth seeks to understand how subtle changes in the user-interface of the new tab page 
            can cause significant implications in the diversity of information sources visited in the internet. To this end, I designed a 
            web-extension that alters the default new-tab page of the web browser by displaying website recommendations under different schemes, 
            namely the most visited sites, the least visited sites, the default high frecency based sites and a blank UI with no websites.
            We convenience sampled around 100 participants and asked them to use our web-extension for two months. Based on detailed analysis
            of the browsing logs collected from those participants, we observed that the passive website recommendations embedded in the new tab displays 
            of browsers (that recommend based on frecency) inhibit peoples' propensity to visit diverse information sources on the internet. The 
            draft of the paper from this project is currently under double-blind peer review. 
          - My work with Prof Piyush focuses on developing a generative zero-shot learning framework for computer vision tasks. Our algorithm
            uses a simple exponential family based generative model for inferring the class conditional distributions of the unseen classes. We use
            use neural networks to parametrize the model and learn the weights of the networks through end-to-end training. In addition, we leverage the 
            generative model to incorporate adversarial domain adaptation for minimizing the domain gap between the true distribution of the unseen classes
            and the corresponding generated distribution. The draft of the paper originating out of this work is currently under double-bind peer review.
